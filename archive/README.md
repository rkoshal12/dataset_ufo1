# dataset_ufo1/archive

### The archive folder contains: 
 - **data that was used in the making of the final dataset**

   - _smaller, individual files that were later integrated either 
   horizontally or vertically_
  

 - **older versions of the final dataset** 
   - *when the dataset is updated at a later month, the previous data set, that doesn't contain those months, 
   will be moved here_
